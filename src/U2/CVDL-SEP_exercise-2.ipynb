    "-  Submission: Put your code and potentially other materials inside a single ZIP file. If you use jupyter notebooks, please always create a PDF file and include it in your ZIP file. The final submission should therefore be a **single zip** file with a **PDF of your code** and the **original code** inside.

    "- `NumPy`: Defines multi-dimensional arrays and provides efficient functions to operate on them (see [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/)).\n",

    "- `Pillow`: Python Imaging Library that allows you to load, save, crop, and resize images (and much more). You can convert NumPy arrays to PIL images and vice versa. Note that Pillow only accepts NumPy arrays in `uint8` format (unsigned 8-bit integer) with each pixel value in range [0, 255] (see [Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).\n",

Then cluster the pixels of the image for $k=2$, $k=24$, and $k=64$ based on their color. Use `n_init=4` and `random_state=0` for the initialization of the `KMeans` class. The cluster centroids can be interpreted as the average color of the pixels in the cluster. For each pixel in the image, assign the color of the cluster centroid it belongs to. Plot the clustered images for the three different values of $k$.\n",
