    "Downsampling in images refers to the process of reducing the resolution of an image and therefore compress the image file. When we are performing downsampling, high-frequency details may not be accurately represented or lost in the lower-resolution version, which leads to aliasing, where sharp edges appear jagged or distorted. In the following exercise you will get your hands on how to implement one of the simplest anti-alising algorithm."
